### Introduction
Hello, traveller! Here I'll share and document every step in my tech journey. Projects and even articles that I can end up writting about something I'm studying. Please, feel free to reach me out, talk about article or make questions about some project.  

### Who am I?
My name is Vin√≠cius, I'm from Brazil and 22 years old. Currently working remote for Compass UOL. I have a 2 years story with WEB, Front End and a bit of mobile, nowadays I work with Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, focusing in Large Language Models. I really enjoy read about Parallel Computing and intend to apply at my work area.

I've already worked with e-commerce, landing pages, mobile development, customer data plattforms, whatsapp chatbots, seo improvements and shopify development.
